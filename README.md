# DQN Insulin Dosage Recommender

This project uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to recommend insulin dosages based on glucose levels. It simulates a custom environment, visualizes learning performance, and includes an interactive GUI using Streamlit.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Custom Gym environment for glucose-insulin simulation
- DQN agent trained to minimize hypo/hyperglycemia risks
- Glucose level and reward progression visualized
- Streamlit GUI for real-time dosage recommendations
- Generates video animation of glucose trends

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python, PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Matplotlib, Pillow
- Streamlit

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
